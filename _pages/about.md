I started a PhD in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Professor David Gleich](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/). I am broadly interested in the low-dimensional representation of structured data which also spans developing localized and fast frameworks.

I obtained an undergraduate background in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering, and dabbled with Electromagnetic imaging and 5G communication for a while before changing fields to graph representation learning for my master's. While still in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, I worked with Prof. Gleich for my master's as well where we worked on PageRank embedding.

Before starting my master's, I briefly worked on with [Professor Anisur Molla](https://sites.google.com/site/mollaanisurrahaman/) distributed algorithms.
