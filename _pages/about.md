I am pursuing my masters with a focus on large-scale network algorithms, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Professor David Gleich](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/). I am broadly interested in structured data, which spans developing efficient algorithms for transductive analysis as well as learning frameworks for inductive analysis.
